Chess is one of the oldest games in the world dating back over 1500 years. The game of chess has evolved as it spread around the globe to the game we play today. As a result, this journey has brought people together from different cultures, ages, and backgrounds over a common bond and passion for the game.
Of course everyone likes to win, but it is just important to learn how to accept losing. As the saying goesâ€”sometimes you give the lesson, and sometimes you receive the lesson! Most important, try to learn from those losses and come back a better player. Just as in life, we need to get back up when confronted with failure and come back stronger and wiser. Winning with grace is an important character trait that chess can teach a person.
The scholastic chess boom around the world has been on a steady rise over the last decade. More important than these children becoming great chess players or getting high ratings is that chess teaches children from an early age that their choices have consequences both good and bad. Thinking your moves through and trying to play the best move that you can is rewarding, while playing too quickly, and rushing your decisions can have negative repercussions.
As Bobby Fischer said, "Chess demands total concentration." A chess player can make moves like a grandmaster for 30 moves and then get distracted on move 31 and make an elementary blunder that loses the game! This intense focus is useful in everyday life when confronted with school assignments, daily tasks, and deadlines.
